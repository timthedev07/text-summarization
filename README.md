# Text Summarization with Deep Learning

This algorithm aims to summarize a piece of text using abstractive summarization.

The trained model will be available in the `model` directory.

The model is trained on google colab because my computer is not built for this purpose hahahahahahaha.(yeah, how nice is that)
